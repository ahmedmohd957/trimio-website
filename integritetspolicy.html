            <h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">By becoming a member or using our Services, you accept and agree to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). Therefore, it is important that you carefully read through these Terms. If you do not consent to these Terms, you should not register
                with Trimio.
            </p>

            <h4>Trimio Services</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio is a platform that connects the best barbers (collectively or individually, "Professionals") providing hair and grooming services ("Grooming Services") with clients seeking such services ("Clients" or "you"). The Professionals and Clients
                are both users of the Services provided by Trimio and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users."</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio solely provides a platform for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Grooming Services. Trimio does not provide or contract for Grooming Services, and Professionals and Clients
                contract independently for the provision of Grooming Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Grooming Services to be provided and the location at which Grooming Services will be performed, whether
                on the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Grooming Services or by a Professional to provide Grooming Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at
                their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and
                Professionals.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Grooming does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Grooming Services provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility
                or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. Trimio makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Grooming Services offered or provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through
                use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional. You understand that Trimio does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background
                of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Trimio does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with
                respect to Grooming Services on the Services. Trimio does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Trimio may, but
                is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background
                check, and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not Trimio conducts a background check or first party interview on a Professional, each Client
                must decide whether a Professional is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY
                NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS
                AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Although the Services are intended to provide a Professional's availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the Professional to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the
                Services is not a guarantee that the Professional will honor the reservation as scheduled.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Trimio cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User.</p>
